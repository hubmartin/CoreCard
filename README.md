# CoreCard

microSD and 3.5mm audio extension board for HARDWARIO Core Module NR.

This board is soledered instead of SPIRIT1 radio module. It takes advantage of separate SPI bus so communication with SD card is not colliding with
SPI bus on the Core Module pin headers. I've also added 3.5mm Jack connector on the bottom because there was nothing to place :) Now you can play WAV or MOD files
and use PWM output with RC filter to play a mono music.
